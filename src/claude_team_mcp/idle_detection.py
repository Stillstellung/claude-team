"""
Idle Detection for Claude Team Workers

Supports two detection modes:

1. Claude Code (Stop Hook Detection):
   Workers are spawned with a Stop hook that fires when Claude finishes responding.
   The hook embeds a session ID marker in the JSONL - if it fired with no subsequent
   messages, the worker is idle.
   Binary state model:
   - Idle: Stop hook fired, no messages after it
   - Working: Either no stop hook yet, or messages exist after the last one

2. Codex (JSONL Event Detection):
   Codex streams JSONL events to stdout. We pipe this through tee to capture it.
   A turn is complete when we see TurnCompleted or TurnFailed events.
   Binary state model:
   - Idle: Last event is TurnCompleted or TurnFailed
   - Working: No terminal event yet, or new TurnStarted after last terminal
